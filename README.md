<summary><strong>üöÄ Deployment & Local Setup Guide</strong></summary>

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LemonmadeDesigns/cloudlock.git
   cd cloudlock
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Copy the following variables and replace with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit your `.env` file to version control!

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Production Deployment

1. **Environment Setup**
   - When deploying to platforms like Netlify or Vercel:
     - Add the following environment variables in your deployment platform:
       - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
       - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

2. **Build Configuration**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
   - Node.js version: 18.x or higher

3. **Supabase Configuration**
   - No additional Supabase configuration is needed
   - The project will continue using the same Supabase instance
   - Ensure your Supabase project's URL is allowed in CORS settings:
     1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
     2. Project Settings ‚Üí API
     3. Add your deployment URL to "Additional Allowed URLs"

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Enable RLS (Row Level Security) in Supabase
   - Configure proper CORS settings
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Never expose admin keys in client-side code

5. **Deployment Platforms**
   
   **Netlify**:
   ```bash
   # Install Netlify CLI
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   
   # Deploy
   netlify deploy
   ```

   **Vercel**:
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm install -g vercel
   
   # Deploy
   vercel
   ```

6. **Post-Deployment**
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Test authentication flow
   - Confirm database connections
   - Check CORS settings if needed

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify environment variables are correct
   - Check Supabase project status
   - Confirm CORS settings in Supabase dashboard

2. **Authentication Problems**
   - Clear browser cache and local storage
   - Verify Supabase URL and anon key
   - Check for proper email configurations in Supabase

3. **Build Failures**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility
   - Check for any environment variable issues

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor Supabase dashboard for issues
   - Review security policies regularly

2. **Backup Strategy**
   - Supabase handles database backups
   - Consider additional backup solutions for critical data
   - Document recovery procedures

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
   - Monitor API usage in Supabase
   - Track authentication attempts
